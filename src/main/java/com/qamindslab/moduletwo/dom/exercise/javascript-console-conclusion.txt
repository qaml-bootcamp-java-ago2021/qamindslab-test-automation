The javascript console help us to find all elements on the DOM. We can use different methods to find elements.

The document is the key word for the DOM and it has differnet methods.

document.head // Shows  the head element.
document.getElementByID() // Find Element by ID
document.getElementByName() // Find Element by Name

It is very useful to practice the commands on console, then we can use them on code knowing they work.
